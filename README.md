# BCS Project 1: ISS Tracker
This is for work and files relating to the BootCampSpot Project 1. This is for aAdelaide August cohort Team Damaged Turtle Flu (Daniel, Himanshu, Nick J).

The topic we have decided to work on is a page that allows the visitor to locate the International Space Station and potentially relate its location to their own via an embedded map.
